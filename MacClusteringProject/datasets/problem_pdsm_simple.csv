Current Activity:
Application support is continuing to reset the profiles of impacted users on an individual basis. VDI machines are showing as unregistered and unable to communicate with the Citrix controllers. This problem was impacting vendors from various locations, but there have been no reports of impact from HCL monitoring teams. There are currently 1699 active sessions and 559 connection failures were reported. Support is manually re-registering some of the machines as needed  and has a plan to re-register several hundreds of machines during normal business hours on Thursday. Support will engage Citrix (vendor) support for further investigation. There will be no further updates until the situation changes.

Business Impact:
Some users are experiencing issues logging into VDI (Virtual Desktop Interface) application.

Terri Hamilton,PRB0062590,FXE_COMSHIPPING,748800,Server,2019-01-21 00:15:28,5163721," Per Narayana Adapa--- This incident ticket combined two different and unrelated issues and the timelines related to them which is showing the total time for the incident incorrectly and longer. Here is the breakdown of two issues:

Issue 1: During CL night development checkout, we observed unexplainable intermittent decoupling flag (to WADM) to support privileges issue that forced us to perform multiple bounces of ADMC. After bounces, we saw erratic behavior where it was working on some servers and not working on other. The issue contributed to display decoupled privileges in the import template. The impact was limited to import functionality if the user chose to include the values for the decouple privileges. Given the time the customer impact was very limited. No commercial impact was observed based on the issue.
• Approximately this issue was observed around 1/20 3:00 AM CST.
• Team took specific action right then to set the default decouple flag to resolve this issue. 
• Team fixed the code and submitted the corrected build as of 5:48 AM with the approximate restart of ADMC with the fix around 7 AM and the checkout showed positive results

Issue 2: During the checkout after the above load, team observed another issue that showed latency with ADMC import batch process connecting to Enterprise Fraud Web Services (EFWS) due to incorrect production EFWS URL configured within ADMC. No customer impact was observed in the 'admc-app' cluster supporting dotcom traffic. Only impact observed was on the 'admc-bp' cluster supporting import, given the time the impact was very limited. No commercial impact was observed based on the issue.
• Approximately this issue was observed around 1/20 8:30 AM CST.
• Team identified the root cause for mitigation and resolution around 1/20 9:30 AM CST
• Team fixed the code by 1/20 11 AM CST.
• Fix was pushed to test levels at 1/20 11:30 AM and production approximately around 3:00 PM CST
• It was decided to bounce the ADMC servers @ standard 11 PM CST on 1/20 (Sunday) to minimize the impact to production.
• ADMC servers in production were bounced at 11 PM CST and checkout showed successful results with issue considered closed around midnight.

Here is my summary of events from the outage this evening.

At approximately 2200 hrs the GOCC and MOCC Phone turrets lost the ability to place and receive phone calls. At 23:06 the command center called me to engage engineering and they reached John Yearwood, who began troubleshooting the issue.

AT 00:44 Mike Sienkowitz called me and asked me to escalate the issue. 

ROOT CAUSE:
It was determined that the gateway hosting the PRI and Mesia Termination Point Resources was not available. In the process, of diagnosing the reason we uncovered that 3 switches 146.18.64.12 .13 and .14 were not available. Further investigation led to the discovery that these devices part of a bulk IOS update by network engineering to address a PSIRT vulnerability. 

Once located we traced the cable from the gateway router to confirm that it was plugged Into the .12 switch that would not recover. Joe and Steve located the .11 switch that was functioning and connected the gateway into port one.

The Turret's still were not restoring. It was determined that the TPO servers that control the Turrets needed to be restarted. We were able to get Jeff Kudrna on the call and restart all 6 TPO servers this completed at 04:02 and service was restored.

We are following the RMA process to replace any and all devices that are not functioning and will review processes involved including support documentation to shorten any future support efforts.

Thanks,

Kevin

Hi Ms. Green,

This is the email of the employee numbers that you requested because the VDI's are running really slow, freezing, and shutting down. This is just a few of the employees; it has been affecting others also. Emily will be taking over when I leave for the day. We are at the FedEx Service Desk located in Memphis (UMRF Ventures).

Bob  Palmeri assesment:

Time line and activities:
•        ITCC reported that issue looks to have started around 1:30 am CT.  
•        I (Bob P) was contacted at 2:11 am and had ITCC bring on DC  network on-call which was Evan Dlugosz.  We had field engineers Jon Williams and Keith also join and started collecting info.
•        Evan joined at 2:17 and after we had checked Nagois, Netcure for any errors on network routers/switches and was clean. 
•        At 2:30 we checked F5 VIP supporting Guru and saw memory at 78.6% and also saw an error establish (TCP: Memory pressure activated).
•        We did a core capture and had instructed Evan to fail over the F5 from primary node to secondary node.
•        2:34 failover complete and we immediately saw the memory drop on both the primary and secondary load balancers drop.  
•        Guru restarted Weblogic app servers and appeared issue was clearing up.  
•        Other apps had to restart and at 2:50 core systems had recovered. 
 
We have F5 engaged and working with our engineers.   We did have a memory threshold alert (60%) occur at 12:04 am and NOC engaged Engineer and F5 but no errors and connection states looked normal.  We are sweeping all F5's to see if the error or condition exists elsewhere and at this time it does not.  We suspect (not confirmed) memory leak but is speculative until we get additional info from F5.
 
We have sent F5 the capture and were given a window from Operations to collect additional info from the standby F5 (initially primary) from 6:00 – 7:00.  This is not expected to be intrusive but are standing down touching anything while flights continuing.  
 
As we get concrete info we will update later this morning

For few, this migration is done and they have issues accessing their FedEx emails: example BO- Avinash, Balaji, FSM-Theertha, Shreyas.
Though BO team accesses Remote Desktops in Memphis, they too cannot access FedEx emails.
We need to know why access is restricted to boxes located at client site? Can it be that this remote machine is not listed in their EDSM?

Subject: Exec notify for Ground/SmartPost Earned Discount issue

Command Center,

There is currently an issue with Ground and SmartPost Earned Discounts that is potentially impacting customers which I'm wondering if we need to send out a SEV4 alert for?  Below is a short summary of the issue…

After a database upgrade over this past weekend, the Ground RADR application is not able to communicate with the GPI MView.  The result of this issue is that Ground and SmartPost customers who have new or changed Earned Discounts since last Sunday will not see those changes reflected in their Ground/SmartPost rate quotes (invoices are not impacted).  Customers that don't have any changes to their Earned Discounts are not impacted.  The DBA team is currently testing a fix for this issue.

This issue started Monday morning (8/20) at 05:01 CT.

Let me know if you'd like any additional details…

       Update: Microsoft Azure is experiencing an issue in their
       US-South Central data center. This is affecting Office365, users
       may be unable to access or use some features within the Office
       365 service. We've determined that a data center issue caused a
       subset of the Office 365 service to become degraded. We're
       connecting some of the affected services to an alternate
       infrastructure, while remediation is underway for the underlying
       issue within the datacenter. Users can use the following link if
       they are still experiencing issues:

       South Central services is being recovered (in process of

       Last Mile. Cross Border impact is that merchant checkout

Status:  Users are no longer having issues sending and receiving emails.


Impact:  Issue is a lot more wide spread then currently seeing due to time of day and the fact that it is email.  Issue started around 8pm CST, when reports started coming in.  Due to it being intermittent, complete impact was not understood.  
• Dubai clearance operations is being impacted as reported by EMEA Service Desk
• FXO Print & Go along with external app alerting
• External mail relay in and out of fedex.com is affected, also any mail system to another system is affected.  Ex. Exchange to o365 or Exchange to iPlanet

Currently, for same batch with different ASN putaway logic, we prohibit them to deposit to same bin location.

 

But I find that there is a bug with this logic. So need your help to confirm and fix it.

 

Below ASN are completed receiving, but putaway record is not received in SFDA system.

 

I checked them in Sterling WMS,  the receipt number is lost with these two ASN.

 

And below inventory are deposited successfully at same bin location with different ASN.

 

So I think that there is a bug with this putaway logic, I think that the root cause is decimal quantity.

 

When the inventory is decimal quantity and less than quantity ""1"", this logic is invalid.

 

Please help to investigate this issue.

02:39 Support is discussing why would the instances go down in the 1st place
02:40 Vivek is informed node 3 is not showing that it started.
02:41 Praveen stated they have put the jobs on hold earlier
02:42 pcd03013 has two processes that have not come down and has to be killed ""PID 599 / 29655""
02:43 Could be why instance did not come down completely
02:45 Per Praveen, webLogic services are working fine and issue appears to be establishing connections
2:45 AM Randhir Kumar (OSV) Randhir joined from Unix team
2:46 AM Randhir Kumar (OSV) Please let me know any assistance required from OS end....
02:47 Impact to international users - had to stop the US collections and Canada credit jobs - seems to be working on the front end 
02:48 Looks like it is clean and ok to start up again 
02:49 Start up issued. ""Alert log is clean and should be able to open. ""
02:50 Per support, looks like some issue on the server, either memory or something like that
02:51 Support reported nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are fine
02:52 Root cause maybe something on the host - process killed and restarted instance seems to indicate some issue on the host
something maybe but don't know what Oracle - suggestion levae instances in the state they are in for root cause analysis for Oracle
2:55 AM Divakar Durgapal (OSV) Randhir Kumar are you still on the call?
2:55 AM Randhir Kumar (OSV) yes I'm there
2:56 AM Divakar Durgapal (OSV) On this call: WebEx: 901-263-5858 (Local)

Access Code: 990 442 984
03:00 Four of the six nodes are up and running
03:01 One Automation job is on hold
      Enable BO SVC1 and as well as another instance are running on node 6. Also another Enable instance is running on node 5 
      so need to relocate the services - kill pmon processes and they will come back running
03:05 currently 4 of 6 nodes are running and are discussing to kill pmon on 5 and 6 
03:05 Support is discussing to shut down and bounce all 6 nodes 
03:05 One server has been up for 594 days. 
03:06 There is a concern for nodes 5 and 6 
03:06 Node 4 says up for 106 days
03:07 fix the ""pmon"" issue - there is a chance 
03:08 Randhir has checked both nodes. No high CPU utilization. 
03:09 Randhir is informed, ""what ever the existing process running is having issues not able to connect""
03:09 Randhir was also informed the ""core dump"" is not enabled on the boxes - 
03:10 support is concerned as they won't really have anything to analyze and looked at for root cause
03:11 suggestion is to restart the servers and the database - 
03:12 trace files will not have enough information for diagnostics. if servers are not touched 
So far pmon - killed the pmon process Oracle automatically restarted it 
03:14 Suggestion was to bounce the db 
03:15 servers 5 and 6 are still having the problem. down for 4 hours and need to get the 
03:16 Concern that the database may not be stable.
03:17 suggestion is to do a full bounce now at this convenient time
03:18 Able to do invoices and okay on the GUI side
03:20 Vivek is having to hang up and rejoin the call
03:21 All nodes experienced the same issue
03:22 EPG / GUI users are able to connect
03:23 Earlier issue was users couldn't log into sequel db, one Automation jobs were failing and currently they are not running collections 
03:26 node 5 is up
03:28 Automation for GRCC has started
03:30 bouncing the database instances 
03:31 One participant reported node 6 has gone down again, but another stated it is up
03:33 Support has decided to reboot everything 1,3, 5 and 6 were having a problem - looks like something got locked up on the host
03:33 Per support, all the nodes are different and is wondering how can 4 nodes have the issue at the same time - 
03:34 node 5 and 6 are being looked into
03:35 Node 2 was untouched and never had an issue. Support is checking the uptime for all the nodes
03:37 core dumps are disabled by default.
03:38 standard outage bounced database instances on all 6 nodes
now - memory related and behavior either by oracle or the host - message reported ""unable to attach memory segment issue "" hard reboot would generally reset it
03:39 Vivek reported the applications being taken down at the moment
03:42 Email being submitted for emergency change is being generated
03:44 Databased instances for nodes 1,3,4, 6 have been bounced
03:47 Currently a hard bounce is being implemented which may take 1.5 hours
03:52 support reported, they're is a full outage at the moment
03:54 Support reported job is running and something is not going down 
03:55 A notification is being prepared for CPG to EPA users will take 1.5 to 2 hours database will not be available and transactions will not be available to them 
03:57 support is requesting to keep and eye on the Database plans 
03:57 Application was just restarted. 
03:57 Once database is backup, a Weblogic restart will be performed
03:58 Generally when the restart is performed, database plans go away
03:59 Good with the payment side / support will perform the bounce based on priority to minimize user impact. 
04:00 Rick stated he can't kill any jobs - Rick was updated. 
Vinod Chiravuri / 812111 is leaving the call
04:05 Rick is seeing issue with the Concurrent manager and is still a lot of jobs still out there
04:06 Rick was asked to leave the jobs as they are. Rick thinks the jobs should be stopped. 
04:06 Some jobs are up and running, some are not. Believes that jobs are stuck because there are too many running. 
04:07 Rick informed Srini he is not able to cancel most of the jobs. They are attempting to stop jobs
04:10 Currently 30 jobs are mentioned
04:11 Rick stated he is able to kill some of the jobs now and asked everyone to hold on
04:13 Rick has stopped all the jobs he can - still show terminating on some programs

Louis Lawrence: Problem Summary: Over the past week multiple stations have reported issues with intermittent eYMS slowness, Oracle Access Manager (OAM) errors, and / or unresponsiveness. The eYMS team has observed in the past, following network interruptions or reboots of WSSO OAM, that the eYMS UI servers can go into a degraded state where they serve requests and are not compatible with WSSO. As a result users that are being served by the impacted sever will experience the OAM errors, or other similar problems.

FedEx.com clients may be experiencing an issue when attempting to create return email labels.  Business impact is currently being assessed. Support teams are engaged to resolve the issue. 
INC010866237
Fedex.com users would have seen failures during email label creation and registration due to cpu usage on the WIDM application. Application was shut down and restarted to restore service. Root cause is unknown at this time.

Per Shawn Patterson-  1) For base OS monitoring…
For #1, we believe we can at minimum automate the OVO ticket creation with a default go live date that AppDev can change, to eliminate the ""human must remember"" dependency.
At best, we're trying to automate the OVO go-live as well, but depends on OVO capabilities.

• Primary short term resolution – each Designer has a responsibility to initiate an OVO request for monitoring servers they are building until CloudOps is able to automate the OVO installs. This has been shared in past cross training and will be emphasized in recurring communications. As noted in the root cause, this is a human dependent process that is occasionally missed. 
• Secondary Contingency plan – Two resources have been provided from the Environment Build Specifications (EBS) Team under Shawn Patterson to support the handling of the initial CloudOps generated EPDSM requests. These resources have helped resolve the open issues to date and will support known requests that are missed. Our understanding is that the CloudOps system has automated the generation of EPDSM requests for each server needing 'base os monitoring' into a common work queue (Q: Jonathan, will you confirm? Does every Production Cloud build automatically create a request? For example, if someone overlooks this OVO step by accident, is a request still generated to offer a full proof way to pro-actively know a system needs OVO vs finding out about it from an incident like this?) and the EBS team will monitor this workload to help as needed. This includes manually creating the actual MTP EPDSM to the OTG team for the monitoring to be turned on 2 weeks after the request submission. An email is also sent to the Application development team for the application by the EBS resources informing them of the MTP request, including the MTP date. The email will be modified to include the application manager, and the need for the application team to request the submission of their application specific monitoring templates and to reply to the EPDSM if they want to change the MTP date for the request. 


  2) For application monitoring…
For #2, we don't have a clear path as less standardized across apps, but Prob Mgmt is getting a meeting together with CloudOps, ArchDel, OTG, and Rely to discuss options.

Did anyone identify a proposed solution for this item?

PROBLEM INVESTIGATION QUESTIONS

1. How and when did we become aware of the problem?  If you were made aware of the issue by the ITCC, how could you be made aware of the issue earlier?
EIT queue threshold mail did alert that the queue was above threshold. APAC/EMEA customer also alerted us about the order drop being slow to Nil
           
2. Was there any Vendor involvement that caused this issue or contributed to lengthening this issue?  If so, which Vendor was involved?
No vendor involvement, but the cause is being investigated
        
3. Was any action required in order to restore service to the user?  If so, what was done?
All the pending messages were moved to a temp queue on the JMS side, and then it was fed back to the production queue in batches which helped in faster message consumption
           
4. Was there a workaround in place that allowed customers to continue working?  If so, what was the workaround?  If not could one be put in place?
There was no workaround in place as this was related to pending messages, and there cannot be one put in place for the same

5. Did the issue cause impact to internal and/or external customers?  What systems were impacted?  What was the impact to the customer?  What was the time frame of the impact?
Internal – Operations did have an impact and there could have been extended processing times for the orders. - +3 hours
Systems Impacted – Sterling WMS / OMS
External – Orders might have missed the ETA for delivery
           
6. During the impact time, what were the total number of transactions processes?  How many of those transactions failed?
Transaction Processed – Orders / Shipments .. Shipments get created from the orders and since orders were not getting created, shipments weren't.
Transactions Failed –  Order transactions ( Create /Schedule / Release)

7. Has the issue ever been seen before in production?  If so, when and what incident number(s) were associated with it?
This issue had occurred in the past / April 2018 - > INC005536219

Improvements – There should have been better co-ordination between the EIT teams of L2 / L3.
There was a huge delay of 2+ hours from moving the messages from the Prod Queue to the Temp queue

10. What is the root cause of the problem?  If it was related to a Change, provide the Change number?
Still under investigation
          
11. Are there any constraints preventing this problem from being resolved?  If so, what are they?
There are no constraints as we have a knowledge article created when this issue had occurred in the past.

Original Problem:
Multiple Ground stations are reporting '1000' and '1045' errors while loading AWAD (Automated Work Area Design) plans as well as slowness with application usage. 

Root Cause:
DBA investigation identified a database in high contention with respect to generation of Inbound Package Reports; however, the high contention also manifested in Active Package backlog and long running continuous submit jobs.  The high contention was investigated by DBA team, which identified this was a known bug associated with LOBs. 

Resolution:
To reduced contention and overall database performance, multiple steps were taken. 
1) Reduced the number of concurrent IBPR jobs that can be run at one time from 15 to 7. 
2) Continuous Submit jobs frequency reduced from every two minutes / location to every 15 minutes / location. 
3) Oracle patch installed as mitigation to the LOB high contention. 
4) Will be able to run more AP consumers. 
5) Post Peak will be distributing load based on location for the UI and Interface Tiers. This will reduce the load on the first DB node.  All nodes will run at the same RPM. 

Follow Up
IM: INC010894450
Since the high volume of package downloads from Cyber Monday (31 million) revealed an upper limit with respect to capacity of the AWAD system, performance was tracked the remaining days of the week and the following Monday (next high volume day (25 million)). The system functioned normally and database showed no signs of high contention.  

Longer term, to position itself for increased volume the team has identified application changes focused on the way information is queried from the Database to be done more efficiently.  The areas of focus are: 

1)  Active Package downloads contention, which limits the ability to scale horizontally.
2) Optimize the  design of continuous submit process for efficiency and scalability.   
3) Optimize the IBPR process for efficiency and scalability.

Update, leak was found on the pipe. Pipe is under unoccupied cabinets. Plan is to bandage the leak for now, this should hold for at least six weeks, at which time they can schedule to replace pipe after PEAK.

Bridge will remain open until we have received the all clear.

Subject: RE: Overtime productivity - (Admins/Agents)

Larraine,  the lag in the system processing the claims has slowed me down quite a bit.  Before the last load, I had started working around 100 claims per day, now it is all I can do to get 50 out.  I hit 50 yesterday per my calculations but it was a complete struggle.  There are the few phone calls that take longer than normal and I attempt to compensate for that but I feel that my slowness lately is due to the time it takes for each screen to process an each task (click) I perform on the screens.

Thank you,
Dena

We have been experiencing issues on EDCW CF ATMOS (object store for EDM) and Data Domain devices.  The problems seem really localized to the EDCW FL2 CFBR cores so not too much impact for us.

BTW – David seems to worked his magic and things are starting to improve.

I have tried failing over interface bond to partner switch, but still experience issues with dropped packets.  Found we also have issues logging into datadomain on 2nd floor EDCw - http://ddedcw0108-cf-fs.inf.fedex.com (10.237.186.19).  This is impacting backup traffic for EDCw CFCR.  Please investigate this from the network side and let me know if you require further info. 
 
Thanks

Good afternoon all,
During Carlos Menezes's staff meeting this afternoon, we discussed this issue and Carlos directed that we proceed with this increase in disk space.  Both efactura and JEM applications failed again today due to disk space limitations.  This is a significant impact to our invoicing operations and a negative customer experience.  

Please proceed with this disk space expansion ASAP.

Thank you, Art

Hi,
I recommend to increase the volume size (T) to support eFactura to from 50gb to at least 300gb.
We need this ASAP as we are during peak in Mexico.
Remember this volume stores documents that usually consume more space that plain data.

Can you please, help?

We will revisit with the vendor next week on how to reduce the amount of logs produced by the system.

Thanks!
Cristian.

Subject: RE: invocacion de Webservice ServicioConsultas

Buenos días, de acuerdo a los acontecimientos de los días Miércoles y Jueves,  se llegó a la conclusión de que están consultando de forma masiva, lo que ocasiona  que se está generando que se acabe el espacio en la unidad T del servidor de e-factura.

La falla en el servidor de e-factura no se debe a la aplicación, si no a que se está rebasando la infraestructura que se tienen actualmente (espacio reservado para la unidad T del servidor productivo de e-factura)

Equipo de LDP:
Por favor me pueden comentar que cantidad de consultas, realizaron en los días miércoles y Jueves pasados.

El día de hoy continuaran con esta actividad?

Independientemente de las respuesta de LDP, si continúan con esto, seguramente se volverá a caer el servicio de e-factura, como sucedió  en días pasados:

Las posibles soluciones:

• Dosificar las peticiones del servidor, con esto se da la oportunidad al proceso de depuración de liberar espacio. (Se puede programar esta actividad por las noches )
• Aumentar el espacio en la unidad T. (la cantidad solicitada debe de ir acorde al análisis de emisión, consulta  que realizan los sistemas actualmente).

Quedo a la espera de sus comentarios.

Saludos.

In short, FedEx has a consolidation system for NCR wherein the customer (NCR) places an order and the system then waits 15 minutes to process the order so that NCR can add any additional parts to the parts to the master order.
 
There does seem to be an issue with O2S in that FedEx sent Airspace 3 orders (1 master/consolidation order and then the 2 individual parts orders).  
 
The ""master"" shipment (1771594) seems to have been sent over first; and then the ""child"" shipments (17715220 and 17715241) were sent over.
 
This issue may be with the FedEx O2S system; and we need a bit of insight as to what is occurring and if we can limit the EDI feed to just the master/parent order.

A total of 4 scanners are down due to errors and 4 are working.  

We recently stood up two new servers for CCII in MEM. 
These servers were built to the specifications of the three other CCII MEM servers that exist today - except the /var partition was not sized the same.  
So the /var partition got full on one of the two new servers and the SO (Socket) domain could not process new connection requests from scan devices. 
Since the blade does a round robin, not all requests were being funneled to that SO instance, hence why there was intermittent connection issues. 
We have also determined that SPLUNK! has not been installed/configured on the boxes, so the full partition alert was not sent because SPLUNK monitors full disks/partitions. 

The host keys need to be added to the known_hosts file in each scanning terminal. 
If not, when the load balancer connects a terminal to a new server, the connection will fail, and the load balancer will try to get a new connection until it goes to an older server. 
Sometimes, the user does not see this especially when the load balancer goes to an older server right away, but if it keeps on going to a new server, the user will see it. 
To correct this, we need to generate their host keys, copy them to the known_hosts file for MEM and ANC, then copy the file to each of the CV61 and CN3e terminals. 

We have shut down the Socket, Scan Client and Scan Engine domains on the new servers that were stood up for MEM and ANC. 
Those domains are running on the original three servers for each location and are processing just fine. 
The users only saw the socket error if the blade directed them to the domain on one of the new servers.

1/24 - 1Source support confirmed issue with Freight Rating (FXFR).  The issue is only with Freight Rate Quote Searches (by Employee ID or by date/time).  This issue is only for a select number of Rate Quote Search types.  We have confirmed that wrong day/time stamp is displaying with (1) employee ID search and (2) account number search.    If we search with Rate Quote number, we see correct day/time stamp.  More importantly, all Freight Rate quotes when emailed or faxed to customers are displaying the correct day/time stamp.

Subject: FW: New version 1Source

Hi all,

After the 1Source load, all centers in Europe are facing issues with Pickup Cut-off time in 1Source.
Cut off times are different than the ones in Cosmos.
Currently the agents are using COSMOS as a workaround, but as not all agents are using Cosmos anymore this need to be handled with priority. (see below example)

We already checked with the local EU LSSI team and no issues were not identified from their side.

Thanks for looking into this.

Subject: New version 1Source

Dear all,

L1 agents highlighted to me, that there are some changes on new 1Source version, that does not allow us to schedule pick-ups correctly.

Let's take for example zip 20090/IT:

FedEx Europe First – cut-off ok at 17.00
FedEx International First – cut-off same than IPF at 11.00, but correct one should be 17.03 (as per Cos2)

FedEx International Priority – cut off displayed at 11.00, but it is not correct, since it's the one for IPF. Correct one as per Cos2 is 17.03
FedEx Priority Overnight – cut-off displayed as IP and it's ok. Is this the default service to be used for normal IP, instead of International Priority?
Service XP Expressfreighter disappeared and we have no choice to select the service and send correct info to the courier. Cut-off for this service is 15.00 under Cos2 service code 98. 

FedEx International Economy – cut-off as IPF at 11.00, but this is not correct. Cut-off should be 17.03 as IP
International Economy Freight – cut-off ok at 11.00
International Priority Freight – cut-off ok at 11.00
Fedex Economy – no cut-off

Can you please verify and let us know, since at the moment it's not possible to schedule via 1Source, due to missing service, or wrong cut-offs.

Thanks and regards

[code]<p>A system capture paid online eCommerce order was unable to transmit into OTP, due to an issue with that order not due to OTP, and instead was sent to the center&#39;s email for production. After the order was completed the center Team Member requests to status the order as &#34;Complete&#34; so the revenue for that order can be released to the center.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution or Answer:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are several solutions for this issue:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. The center could contact the Enterprise Service Desk at 1.800.546.5674 or open a case on the Self-Service Portal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. If the order could not be received into OTP and was sent to the center&#39;s usa email box by the monitoring system, the center&#39;s manager received a copy of the email with a link to click on to update the status of the order as &#34;Completed&#34;.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Some orders are delayed or fail to be sent to the center&#39;s OTP system and are emailed to the center by a monitoring system. If those orders never arrive in the center&#39;s system they do not have a way to status the order as complete to receive the revenue.</p>

TBT-SORT is a monolithic java program that contains ~25 separate Shipment and Sort processes. Bob McNeese and I have a verbal agreement that when the time is right we shall pull out the ""Sort"" processes and have them owned by Hackslash. Until then we own it. TBT-SORT uses weblogic and based on what my team tells me weblogic has trouble reestablishing database connections to the IBMi following IPL's and role swaps. Therefore, as a standard practice we bounce all the servers. My WiPro team which provides 24*7 coverage has been handling these steps since I came to this group 1.5 years ago. 

Unfortunately on the most recent role swap and IPL we have failed in our checkouts resulting in several different production problems. This has exposed a number of opportunities for improvement. So much so that I have made the decision to pull team members off of Runs With Scissors to provide the man power necessary to execute on these opportunities and stabilize the TBT-SORT application. This will impact ExOD and other work. I

My plan involves moving the newly freed RWS team members to my production support team (we need a better name) and putting them to work full time on the following:

1. Improving the application checkout procedure for TBT-SORT
2. Executing on specific threshold monitoring and alerting opportunities that have already been exposed 
3. Better utilizing existing App Dynamics tools and expanding the capability to include alerting

Here is the summary of what happen today: 

At 10:15am Central Time.. 15:15 GMT.. the WTC to EDCW 10Gbs circuit that served the Vendor connectivity and the Customer Facing between EDCW and WTC was down due to Sprint fiber cut PL660630 in Kansas City. 
No business impact as all traffic was re-routed to the secondary WTC-CTC-EDCW 10Gbs links.

At 4:07pm Central Time, the secondary Centurylink / Level3 link bounced multiple times, causing a degraded communication for Customer Facing and causing lost connectivity for the vendor network. 
Business impact including traffic between data center for fedex.com and any customer facing apps, and vendor connectivity, including offsite customer services and managed services 
The circuit bounced last approximately 1 hours, that at 5:08pm Central Time.. fedex.com traffic restored. 
At 6:28pm, the vendor connectivity restored. 

At no time the back office communication was impacted during the above incident. 

Sprint indicated that it will take another 8-11 hours to restore the circuits. 

To ensure that the bounce of the circuits will not have further impact, Mike Cueria will enable the 2 1Gbs circuits between EDCW and WTC to restore redundancy during the fiber cut outage for the customer facing and vendor networks to minimized any impact in the case the secondary 10Gbs bounced again tonight before the WTC-EDCW 10Gbs circuit restored. Emergency Change is open for this.

After reviewing the log files Oracle has made a recommendation (detail provided at bottom of email). The PLA environment uses a 10g client with an 11g database. While this configuration works Oracle is proposing a change to improve how the client passes connection from the application to the database. This is not ultimate root cause and Oracle has requested additional information to find root cause. The plan for Thursday sorts is for the NWST, NCAL, BAYA, LAMR, and SCAL districts (65 stations in EDC, 333 station on PGH) to sort on the EDC systems tomorrow. We will also have active monitoring form the application, database, and server teams beginning at 03:00.

Immediate Actions:
1) Apply changes to Remote Listener per Oracle to EDC – Complete
2) Actively monitor Thursday sorts
3) No mass failovers will be done without Kevin Dexter and Jim Connolly approving since the problem followed from EDC to PGH when a mass failover occurred making the problem worse. Failovers will be done on a station by station basis.
4) Daily update meetings until root cause found

Short Term (1 day to 2 weeks) Actions:
1) Apply changes to Remote Listener per Oracle to PGH
2) Provide Oracle with PLA connection code for a code review
3) Deploy PLA reconnection logic after disconnect – Code complete and in QA. Ready for prod in <2 weeks
4) Gather and provide additional data requested by Oracle

Long Term Actions:
1) Upgrade Oracle client version from 10g to 11g
2) Full regression and load test of PLA with an 11g client and 11g database including destructive testing
3) Continue QAT actions around PLA HA and redundancy options

Issue Monday  5/21/2018 10:48 PM PRB0046068 TMS – PLD:

Description/Status
The Package Level Detail (PLD) process in TMS was incorrectly setting packages to Ground (Cold) service. This caused trailers to close Cold, rather than Mainline Hot or Overnight. The issue was mitigated at approximately 21:30 Eastern by restarting the existing process and confirming it was setting the service types correctly. Some trailers may still close with the incorrect service, but by tomorrow morning it should be completely resolved.

Root Cause
A defect in the new PLD code that was deployed on 5/20 caused the package service to be incorrect. 

Business Impact
Linehaul Operations had to manually re-close trailers that had the incorrect service. We do not anticipate any failures at this time, however we will be working closely with PGH Linehaul to monitor the situation. The impact was sporadic and affected approximately 50% of Mainline Hot and Overnight packages. Approximately 7100 trailers had the potential to be impacted.

Next Steps
• Develop and test fix for this defect and find a new date to deploy the application.
• Add test cases to the PLD regression to ensure we have no additional escaped defects.

Naveen Kumar,PRB0060455,FSC_L3WMSSTERLINGLOFT,0,Database,2018-07-13 15:16:53,admin5069733,"Issue The issue is the MODIFYTS field in the shipment_ container table is not getting updated once the shipment is delivered. 
The other field which is EXTN_FDELIVERY in the shipment_ container  table does get updated as soon as the package gets the delivery scan with the local delivery scan time in the DB



Examples
(Incident & description) Here is a sample of a shipment which was shipped yesterday and delivered today.
Shipment # 553839145  , shipped on 01/03 and delivered on 01/04
 
Container Details
 
 
Tracking # 414068266996
If the above tracking number is checked in fedex.com , it shows delivered at 10:21 EST ( Scan time at the destination)
 
 
 
The below highlighted field of EXTN_FDELIVERY in yellow matches the delivery time (EST) in fedex.com, but the MODIFYTS isn't getting updated and shows the time when the container last got updated

In this case it is the time when it passed through the MHE. ( time in GMT for this field)
 
 
 
The BI team is expecting the MODIFYTS field also to get updated after the EXTN_FDELIVERY gets updated which isn't the case here.



Impact Statement When the tracking information exist in Sterling but not Datamart, the  reporting to the customers is missing Fedex's delivery information. This results into the table not getting the Modufyts field updated telling the ETL that something changed and to update the Datamart for  reporting and dashboards. 


Analysis Unqualified analysis: 
Starting date going forward is  20180101   
     
There were 0 Delivery Dates Equal the Container Time Stamp 
     
There were  25,178 UnMatched Rows

Team,
We are getting the above error whenever user tried to access to a page on Sterling Console which the user has no permission to. However, this error was written into weblogic ManagedServer log, instead of application log. As a result, OVO alert was triggered, because it is a <Error> containing ""com.yantra.jsp.yfcerror""

Please investigate:
1. The RCA of this particular error captured in Weblogic ManagedServer log. It seems like when a user tried to click on a ""resource"" (a page on the sterling console) without the proper permission, this would result in this error, and the error appeared on Weblogic ManagedServer log. 
2. This error log seems to be application level, so it should be captured in the log under /var/fedex/wms/log/agent, but not in the Weblogic ManagedServer log which is system levl
3. What need to be done in order for this log to appear only in application log. 
4. Can identify what other Sterling application log that will appear in Weblogic ManagedServer log

To prevent the shipment cancellation from simply resulting in a new shipment being created prior to order cancellation, Sterling provides for the user canceling the shipment to place the associated order in backorder, which prevents a new shipment from being generated.

What we are finding is that when the order is placed into Backorder, Sterling is actually creating TWO backorder release status records per order line - total quantity, one record in 1300 backorder, one record in 1400 backorder.  When the order is cancelled - a new 9000 status order release status is created with status quantity and the backorder record with status 1300 is set to 0 - but the status 1400 release status record is left active wit the order line quantity

The production/hold days for table YFS_LOCN_INVENTORY_AUDIT is currently set to 180 days.  This is not the correct setting – experience with the application and indicates that this table should be archived/purged after 160 days to avoid performance issues

In addition, two tables associated with the Authenticator process need to be purged of data more than 8 days old: YFS_USER_ACT_AUDIT and YFS_USER_ACTIVITY.  If not purged these tables – but particularly YFS_USER_ACT_AUDIT – grow to a large sixes and ultimately significantly impact application performance
These purges should specifically be directed to records associated with user_id ""tibco"", which is associated with connections to Sterling via O2S

Examples

In the case of YFS_LOCN_INVENTORY_AUDIT, records more than 160 days old should be moved to a history table YFS_LOCN_INVENTORY_AUDIT_HIST 
insert into fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_locn_inventory_audit_hist 
 (select * from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_locn_inventory_audit
   where locn_inventory_audit_key < to_char(sysdate - 160, 'YYYYMMDD'));
commit;

delete from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_locn_inventory_audit    
 where locn_inventory_audit_key < to_char(sysdate - 160, 'YYYYMMDD');
commit


In the case of YFS_USER_ACT_AUDIT and YFS_USER_ACTIVITY, no archive is needed, just purge of records related to ""tibco"" activity

delete from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_user_act_audit 
 where user_id = 'tibco' 
   and user_act_audit_key < to_char(trunc(sysdate-8),'YYYYMMDD');

An example of this occurred recently when a user was originally creating an order for customer ABT and selected an ABT Tech as the recipient, but switched to creating an INT order without completely clearing and restarting the order.  The result was that an INT order was shipped to a ABT Technician

This was a user error that could easily occur because there is no validation being performed between the enterprise code of the items on the order (that is, the enterprise associated with the order) and a specified recipient enterprise when a recipient enterprise is also specified

Update
 
Further discussion has turned up the fact that at one time, if an O2S user had more than one O2S session open (say two sessions of O2S, each in its own browser window) it sometimes occurred that data entered in one O2S session could appear in the other O2S session

 That is, if a user has two O2S sessions open in separate browser windows and they were creating an order in one, then started creating a second order for a different customer in the second before completing the order previously started in the first session, some of the data entered in the second order could appear in the unfinished first order in the other session 

While this issue is believed to have been addressed quite a while ago, it might make sense as a first step to confirm that this is still no longer an issue and that the past issue of data from one O2S session showing up in a second separate O2S session on the same user PC has not returned",0,1 - High,FedEx Supply Chain,False,2018-07-13 15:17:01,Admin-Arturo Reyes,2 - High,0,0,FSC - O2S : Lack of account validation during Order creation in O2S has potential of shipping items to wrong customer,Standard,2019-01-25 00:44:28,admin5041253,2,2 - Medium,Application,,

After this was completed NFO orders were missing the 2nd leg of mileage, Saturday, Sunday and Afterhours on the AP.  After I put the reciprocal flag back in place on NFO orders that orders pulled the additional correct charges. 

Now it seems if the reciprocal flag is on for NFO's, O2S pulls the wrong rate, but if it's not on then the second leg is missing.  Took the flag to pull the correct rate and now we have 31 shipments that are missing the second leg.  In addition we have the following rating issues.

1. Order/Shipment # which had this issue.- Given below in table.
2. UNPACK happens after container close ? Or before container close ?- UNPACK after after container close.
3. Happening only with Serial item ? or Non-Serial item also have this problem ?- Happens mostly will serialize items ,but few times with non-serialize items also.
4. Is both are valid scenario ?
a. UNPACK after container close- Yes this was the valid scenarios in most of the cases
b. UNPACK before container close- In past ,it happen very rarely, as we are packing all items for order in single virtual container. But now it can happen regularly, as system packing will happen as per physical packing.
5. What is the workaround solution followed ?-  
a. Most of the cases ,were belong to wrong serial entry in given shipment, which were supposed to pack for another shipment. There were no issue ,where qty need to unpack from any given container in shipment and need to re pack in another container of same shipment.

Analysis: User updated the delivered time from workflow update. When updates happens it updates the package table delivered time. In this case system is not converting the time to GMT time zone. Thus while retrieving back the date/time system assumes the time to be in GMT and further converts the time to MST. Thus showing the wrong time.

Analysis: Analysis shows that the charge notification did went correctly to TM400 having only the warehouse after hours charge. But the display was wrong showing the same charge for both warehouse and transport section.

It appears to be a display issue only. 

The change in vendor_cost table has single entry and there are no duplicate charges in DB. The display is wrong on screen. And that needs to be corrected.

For the order below is the expectation:

The billing tab should show the following:
1.       After hours the agent entered should show in WHSE section
2.       The After hours of $20.00 (which didn't fall in after hours time frame shouldn't be on billing tab).

03/02/15 14:11:35 (BEHERA, SAGAR KUMAR):
All,
   We discovered that our ETL for the Orders and Shipments reports failed on Thursday afternoon.  ALL Orders and Shipments reports will be blank until we can get the ETL fixed and running again.
There are multiple tickets Open for this issue.  You can append the issue to open tickets, or just consider them as duplicate tickets.
We'll let you know when we are up and running again.
Thanks

NOTE:  The Inventory reports and the Receipts reports are OK, this is affecting the Orders/Shipments/Sales reports.

Joe

============

Receipts reports are not complete. Receipts are tied to Shipments (Inbound) that are missing after 2/26 @11:35 am EST.

The only Receipts that would show up in Datamart reports would be those ASN's that were loaded before the last ETL  date mentioned above.

Regards,
Joseph Baddour

ISSUE:  Customer received a copy of the shipping activity report for 2-27-15 through 3-1-15, and it was blank.  (please see attachment of Copy of Rap FSC US SHP100d report).  I ran the report in O2S, and was able to gather the data (please see attachment   of RAP SHIPPING REPORT 2-27-15 to 3-1-15).  Please advise why the one report is blank.

Knowledge article KB000017954:
[code]<p>Team Member is wanting to know how to determine if a Brother 7240/6200/5240/5250/5370/MFC 7220 is under warranty from Brother. This method is only used to determine factory warranty from Brother on a Brother machine. If the center has purchased an extended warranty on Brother equipment via ePro, the Team Member must reference the purchase date of the equipment via their ePro order documentation and then contact CompuCom for extended warranty service.</p>
<p><strong>Solution or Answer:</strong></p>
<p>1. Team Members can verify warranty by checking the serial number.  For example: U61327A6J750445</p>
<p>2. The 7th character from the left the number that follows it shows the date that the factory warranty began.</p>
<p>3. The characters indicate the month: A&#61;Jan, B&#61;Feb, C&#61;March, D&#61;April, E&#61;May, F&#61;June, G&#61; July, H&#61;August, (NO I), J&#61;September, K&#61;October, L-November and M&#61;December.</p>
<p>4. The number that follows indicates the year, so 6 &#61; 2016, 7 &#61; 2017. In this case A6 &#61; January, 2016. From then until now is 31-32 months. Factory warranties are 18 months. Therefore, the example serial number is out of warranty.</p>

Root Cause : NCC Orders are failing to send the Order Confirmations due to ""Item Description exceeding 64 chars"". Item descriptions are deriving from Sterling. Irrespective of enterpise, whatever the item descriptions are stored in Sterling which are more than 64 chars, it will fail in Tibco to send the Order Confirmations due to limitation.

Impact: Medium - Daily about 3-4 tickets. 

Analysis - Tibco L3 and Fedex Net team are engaged on this issue and they are determining for fix.

Sample tickets :

01/08/15 17:06:01 (BEHERA, SAGAR KUMAR):
Hi Rami,

Following comment mention in the attached mail for reference, seems issue is related to coding in O2S. Please assist to proceed further.

Comments:
When we enter a new customer ship address and enter the time zone for the location, the portal doesn't save it.  We have to exit and open the address for editing and enter the time zone again.  We have to do this for every address we create.  The time              zone save after we edit, but during the creation of the address.

Thanks and Regards

Background:
-----------
Since we started working with NCR, the customer has established a habit of resending ALL open inbound ASNs that Fedex could possibley receive against
 
So, every morning, if there had been 2000 open inbound ASNs at the end of the day before, NCR would resend those 2000 open inbound ASNs to us, along with any new inbound ASNs
 
As a result of this, a routine was put in place to delete all inbound NCF and NCC asns every early morning that were in status 1400 - this eliminated any problems associated with the creation of duplicate shipments
 
However a few months ago, NCR started sending up ASNs from a supplier Synchreon
 
Synchreon DOES NOT resend all of its ASN every day, and NCR does not resend Synchreon ASNs every morning
 
As a result - if the Synchreon ASNs are deleted, they are gone. 
 
To receive Synchreon material, L2 has to restore the missing ASNs by replaying them out of Fedexnet.  However, this will only work for ASNs of a particular age, since Fedexnet does not maintain all of the documents past a certain age
 
The solution to this issue is to modify the NCR delete routine that runs nightly to NOT delete Synchreon ASNs.
 
Synchreon ASNs can be identified by the fact that the bol_no field is always and uniquely populated with a value that starts with ""M0""
 
So, if the current logic is something like:
 
   delete from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
    where document_type   = '0005'
      and enterprise_code = 'NCF'
      and status          = '1400'
       
   it would be changed to something like:
   
   delete from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
    where document_type   = '0005'
      and enterprise_code = 'NCF'
      and status          = '1400'   
      and bol_no   not like 'M0%'
       
That's It.  But L3 has Not Made The Change, and deletion of these ASNs is significantly hurting our operation
 
In the short run, I am bypassing the issue by changing enterprise codes and organization codes associated with Synchron inbound ASNs that are in Status every night and then changing them back in the morning
 
So, every night around 9:00 PM CST I run the following:
 
   update fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
    set seller_organization_code = 'NXX', enterprise_code = 'NXX'
   where shipment_key in
   (select shipment_key from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
    where enterprise_code = 'NCF' and bol_no like 'M0%' and status = '1400');
          
   followed by a clear of the Sterling cache
 
Then, every morning around 5:00 AM CST, I run the following:
    
   update fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
    set seller_organization_code = 'NCF', enterprise_code = 'NCF'
   where shipment_key in
   (select shipment_key from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
    where enterprise_code = 'NXX' and bol_no like 'M0%' and status = '1400') 
   and shipment_no not in
   (select shipment_no from fscyan_yanpdown_schema.yfs_shipment
     where enterprise_code = 'NCF');  
      
   followed by a clear of the Sterling cache
   
This is, of course, a silly thing to have to be doing

Hi Jeremiah,

We notice that the Inventory snapshot rendering has failed for situations where the Sterling response has been a huge XML file.
The approximate Sterling Inventory snapshot file size is between 25mb – 26mb.
The TIBCO process is coming across java heap space issue trying to render the XML output.
The existing design has a limitation trying to transform messages when size is in the above range.

Please open a RCA and assign this to TIBCO team.

TIBCO changes were put in place some time ago to prevent these attributes from being changed via customer 888, to stop the same sort of issues from ocurring

We now find that these attributes are NOT CHANGEABLE in the Sterling Console, Even If There Is No Inventory For The Item In Questions

I can understand Logic being added that prevents these attributes from being changed IF there is inventory for the item in the system

IT MAKES NO SENSE to prevent these item master attributes from being changed If Inventory Has Been Adjusted Out Just So Item Master Changes Can Be Made

The correct logic here would be to prevent these item master attributes from being changed ONLY if there is inventory in the system

This issue is preventing CFT and IC personnel from performing their jobs without the assistance of IT performing changes at the DB level - this intervention should not be required",0,1 - High,FedEx Supply Chain,False,2018-07-13 15:17:21,Admin-Arturo Reyes,1 - Critical,1,0,FSC - Changes To Sterling Item Master Console To Prevent Some Issues Has Caused Others,Standard,2019-01-25 00:44:41,admin5041253,5,1 - High,Application,,

Christopher Barber,PRB0060980,FXS_EIS_GLB_ProblemMgmt,0,Printer,2018-07-13 15:17:23,admin5069733,"Memphis Hub reported 20 portable printers were unable to connect to the wireless network. 
Support identified a firmware version that was incompatible with certain wireless access points. 
Later the printers received a version that was compatible. 

last year Honeywell identified a firmware issue and suggested a fix. 
a few weeks ago they realized there was an older version of firmware being loaded onto printers. 
he worked with tech services to inventory all the printers and id any that did not have the correct version of firmware (for updating). 
had a conference call today (9/29) regarding this. 
appears as though the newer firmware fixes the WAP connectivity issue but has problem connecting to the Avalanche servers. 
as a result, the older version of firmware was used. 
this issue only occurs with Motorola access points, which are scheduled to be deployed in NWK and ANC. 
CCII team has communicated remediation steps with the field. 

after jan Peak, they rolled out CCII software everywhere. 
a problem was id in april where older printer models had a HW component that was incompatible with the firmware. 
so the component had to be replace before firmware upgrade, esp since NWK was going to new Motorola APs. 
id quite a few printers that needed the new HW. 
RSC worked with the vendor to get more parts. 
in july the new APs were introduced. 
might have been some comm issues between RSC, TS and Ed. 
at some point the older firmware got reintroduced, leading to the problem on 9/24. 
working on communicating better and being in the decision loop of when certain firmware is applied. 

these printers likely had been working fine before. 
on 9/24 they had been repaired and put into service but the extra volume of the week might have caused timeouts
when there's a lot of ARP traffic, the older firmware printers began rebooting because of the many (14) swaps/handshakes of info. 
have now updated all 20 printers with the correct version, including an additional 6 as a result of an inventory. 

according to Janet Smith, they never apply the new version of firmware. 
that was due to the Avalanche/AP issue - printers could not finish the repair process. 
however, if they downgrade to the older firmware then the repair process could finish. 
Ed was told there was a workaround to get the newer firmware but that was not quite right.

Issue Monday 12/03/2018 INC010924695/PRB0062135 NGW stop counts: NGW scanners were showing the correct number of stop counts but the manifests were not updating to reflect the correct work areas. Follow up on business impact and job scheduling. Anthony Luke and Rachel Black. 

Name(s): Rakesh Kumar Nayak , Leah Kozak, Sara Hann, Corey Joseph Blackwell, Joe Osick, Anthony Luke, Floyd Tame, Rachel Black,Aaron Wheeler (User) 
Location (#/Abbrv): 0468/FTWA , 0181/ALLG , 0372/NASL  
Application: Vision 
Problem: NGW scanners were showing the correct number of stop counts but the manifests were not updating to reflect the correct work areas.  
Help Ticket: INC010924695 
Time/Duration or Downtime: 12/02/2018 - 08:20 /~ 3 Hours 25 Minutes 
Business Impact: Possibly delay to sort/dispatch.  
Operational Actions/ Contingencies: None 
Status/Timeline/Next Steps: 08:20 - Site 0468/FTWA called in because its NGW scanners were showing the correct number of stop counts; however the manifests were not updating for the scans done on Sunday morning. 
08:24 - Support requested track IDs from the station to review.
08:35 - Support verified the track IDs provided by the site and checked the active flags for the station. 
08:45 - Verified the correct AWAD plan was also active for the site.
08:50 - Sara Hann called FASS Support and requested to contact Preload On-Call. Support contacted Joe Osick. 
09:00 - Support provided Joe the track IDs and investigation was done.
09:11 - FASS Lead was contacted and a bridge call was initiated. 
09:30 - Additional track IDs were collected and verified.
09:32 - Corey confirmed that he was able to see records in Scan ODS from 12/02/18, but could not see van scan records in Ftrack.
09:39 - Support called Manifest on-call Floyd Tame, who suggested to contact the TBT on-call because a required job that aids in moving the jobs to manfiest is known not to run on Sundays. The TBT team could confirm the job details. Floyd also guided L2 in verifying correct jobs were running on PITT1. These jobs were up with no backlog. 
09:44 - TBT manager Anthony Luke was contacted. He and some of his team would join the call. 
09:50 - 0181/ALLG and 0372/NASL called in for the same issue.
10:02- Sort Manager from 0468/FTWA confirmed that at 05:35 EST he scanned the packages and printed the manifest it printed correct for work area 952.
10:20 - Floyd Tame joined the call.
10:41 - Data was coming from Preload server FP0468A2 for the site 0468/FTWA.
10:50 - TBT confirmed that legacy OFFMOVE jobs, owned by TBT do not start until 12:00 am on Sundays.This is the job that processes the van scan data data downstream to PDA450F for manifests. 
10:59 - TBT started the job manually and it began running with no errors. PDA450F was monitored to see if data would begin to populate. 
11:10 - After this it was discovered that the Vision copy process that runs at 6am on Sunday updated the timestamp 24 hours from the scan on Saturday, which overwrote the physical scan from the station on Sunday morning. Because most stations do not scan on Sunday mornings, the problem did not impact more stations. 
11:20 - It was discussed adjusting the copy process to make the timestamp of the Sunday copy scan earlier in the day actual so that Sunday station activity is not overwritten moving forward.
11: 45 - Support followed up with all the stations and suggested workaround of re-scanning the packages so the manifests would update properly. All stations had dispatched for the day.Stations were also advised by Vison Business that any returned packages from today's date should be re-scanned Monday morning to ensure its on the correct manifest 

Support will follow up with the sites for the impact.

As discussed with you both – it was raised in the WAR meeting that there a CIT issue which could not be tested due a external environment for the impacted customer. 
 
This is a prime use case for Service Virtualisation and I am paying for a team who are currently under-utilised. Please can you follow up on a number of actions on this : 
 
a)       Can you review any opportunities for SV In this space and add them to our Backlog 
b)      Can you ensure you flag any future requirements prior to commencement of testing. These can be delivered quickly. 
 
Claire – Can we track this action through the WAR meeting please ? 

Thanks

Cons Affected: Special services division S cons that have a FRTNV entry added through GL+. 
 
Issue description: Consignment  is at status CR in the financial database( YCPFI00R) and all it has is the SED element as a type 5 but there is no type 1 entry . GL+ adds the FRTNV entry along with the partial hand rate and the con is moved to AR status directly from CR and in this GL + Flow the SED getting deleted from the financial database. If the con goes from here to invoiced the SED is never getting attracted/the SED may get added & deleted in the Rating and Invoicing Suit.
 
Symptoms 
The cons were missing the SED surcharge and may cause issues with the rate.

Time/Duration or Downtime: 02/16/2019 - 11:00 / ~ 4 hours 
Business Impact: There was a brief delay in dispatch and some drivers would not have Turn-by-Turn directions available; however, there were no service failures.. 
Operational Actions/ Contingencies: eManifests were available 
Status/Timeline/Next Steps: 11:01 - INC011255769 received. Support contacted LRLT/924 concerning the issue they reported: manifest were printing with incomplete data. Support began gathering information and troubleshooting. Issue was duplicated by support. Support checked into Cypress and discovered that printouts corresponded to what was in Cypress archives and not with current scanner information, indicating that it was not a Cypress issue.
11:46 - Contacted Manifest on-call [Floyd Tame] who directed us to L3.
11:50 - Contacted L3 [Rambo] who required an email with details before troubleshooting could begin.
12:04 - Emailed L3.
12:07 - L3 found that the Sequenced Manifest Settings were unavailable to be checked, therefore they requested a DO command be run on the PDA382RU job on PITT1.
12:25 - The DO command was completed; however, the Station indicated no change in condition.
12:36 - L3 [Melissa] requested further detail. Station was contacted and additional information gathered. Additional stations called in with sequencing Manifest issues. 
13:10 - Final batch of information provided by station and forwarded to L3.
13:49 - L3 [Melissa] requested DO command again be run on PDA382RU job on PITT1. When completed, it was found that all affected stations had Sequence and Turn-by-Turn boxes unchecked. Stations needed to manually check those boxes.
15:00 - All stations had been contacted and corrected.

Root Cause: Per L3 [Melissa] ""It appears that after the flip to the centralized environment yesterday the server times were off. The server times appear to be in GMT this would affect what is put on the manifest because remember manifest looks to time of scan to determine what should be put on the manifest.""

 Issue Monday 02/18/2019 10:37 PM: New Incident - Stations not able to select 'Opted-In'.

New Incident:  Stations not able to select 'Opted-In' work areas to print sequentially : 2-15-19 & 2-16-19

Issue:
The PDA382RU job makes a request to CDAS to see if there are any new contracts that have 'opted in' of sequenced manifests via MGBA.  If a contract has an 'opt in' then the work area will activate and the station can select that work area to print sequentially.  The job did not complete successfully on 2-15-19 & 2-16-19 and caused stations to not be able to select 'opted- in' work areas to print sequentially. 

Business Impact:
Nine stations

Root Cause:
Researching root cause.  I scheduled a meeting with Vision, CDAS, L3 and DBAs on Wednesday, 2-20-19.  I will follow-up after that meeting.
Specific examples researched point to entities that have more than one contract. Only one contract is showing opted in for sequenced manifest. This is not widespread at stations.  Meeting with CDAS to understand how the process should work with multiple agreements.

Resolution:
Pending results of the meeting
